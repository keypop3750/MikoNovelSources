```

### Creating a New Source

1. Create a new package under `extensions/en/<sourcename>/`
2. Create a source class extending `NovelSource`
3. Implement required methods: `search()`, `getNovelDetails()`, `getChapterList()`, `getChapterContent()`
4. Create a `*Factory.kt` class extending `NovelSourceFactory` to register the source
5. Add a `build.gradle` with the extension's package name and version
6. Add the extension entry to `index.min.json`
7. Build and test

### Optional Capabilities

Sources can declare optional capabilities by overriding `getCapabilities()`:

- `supportsComments` — enables chapter comments; implement `getChapterComments()` to parse comments from the chapter page
- `supportedSorts` — declares which sort options the source supports for browsing
- `supportsSearch` — whether the source supports text search
